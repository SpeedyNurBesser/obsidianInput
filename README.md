# obsidianInput
A short python program designed to quickly input ideas into your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault.

ObsidianInput is simply an .exe file initally designed to be run by a Stream Deck, but can just as well be run by a keyboard shortcut or something.

With ObsidianInput you can create a new file, append or prepend text to an existing file, and append or prepend to your IDEAS file, if you have an ideas file. A ideas file for me is simply a file with dozens of bullet points of project ideas.

ObsidianInput comes with a config file to change some setting and most importantly set the directory of your Obsidian Vault.
